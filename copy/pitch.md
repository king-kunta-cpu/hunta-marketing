# Hunta — pitches & positioning

Official tagline (README): **“Jobs found. Applications drafted. You tap approve. It sends.”**

---

## Elevator pitch (30 s)

Hunta is a job-hunting copilot for career coaches in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia.
It sweeps 18 job boards on a schedule — PNet, CareerJunction, JobMail, VacancyMail,
iHarareJobs, GoZambiaJobs and more — matches every ad against your candidate's real profile,
scores the fit, then drafts a tailored cover letter and a country-formatted CV as PDFs.
The whole thing lands in your Discord as a single card with a ✅ and a ❌. Tap approve and it
sends the application from the candidate's own Gmail. Nothing ever goes out without your tap.

## One-liner (15 s)

Hunta finds the jobs, drafts the application, and waits for your tap. You stay the professional
in the loop; Hunta does the forty-tabs part.

## Tweet-length

Your candidates aren't losing to better candidates. They're losing to the 40 open tabs.
Hunta hunts, drafts, and asks before it sends.

## Positioning statement

For **career coaches, outplacement teams and job-search mentors in ZA / ZW / ZM** who lose
billable hours to board-by-board searching and letter rewriting, **Hunta** is a
**human-in-the-loop application pipeline** that turns a private Discord channel into a
**deal-flow desk for job applications**. Unlike CV mass-mailers and AI “apply for me” bots,
Hunta **never sends anything without approval, never invents a word of experience, and deletes
its own work product after 72 hours** — so you scale your judgement instead of outsourcing it.

## Stat block (verified, 2026-09-17, from production logs)

- 18 board integrations across ZA · ZW · ZM · remote; 11 returned live results on the latest run
- 41 drafted applications sitting in one Discord-linked pipeline, each with CV + letter PDFs
- ONE LLM call per job: score + letter + tailored CV (≈3× cheaper than score-then-draft)
- 0 auto-sends by design — every application is a human tap
- PDFs purged at 72 h; deleted the moment you send or reject
- $0 hosting: two GitHub Actions workflows, no server, no credit card
- 20 sends/day/candidate hard cap to protect the candidate's own Gmail reputation

## Don't say

- “AI applies for you” (we don't — a human approves every send; saying otherwise is false and
  invites Gmail abuse questions)
- “guaranteed interviews” (no such thing; we sell hours saved and coverage, not outcomes)
- “scrapes LinkedIn” (we don't log in or scrape profiles; public job search only)
- “unlimited applications” (we deliberately cap volume; quality-over-spam is the pitch)
