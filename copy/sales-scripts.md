# Hunta — sales script library

Every script assumes the **free demo** is the offer on the table: anyone gets it, no card,
no call required. The paid conversation only starts after they've seen a card land.

Voice rules (BRAND.md): plain, specific, the human is the hero, never "bot", never
"guaranteed interviews". The word **demo** means *free forever tier* — 1 candidate,
5 sends a month — not a time-boxed trial.

## 0 · The offer stack (memorise this)

| Tier | Price | What |
|---|---|---|
| **Demo** | R0 forever | 1 candidate, full pipeline, 5 sends/month, Discord card + PDFs |
| **Solo** | R299/mo (~$17) | 3 candidates, 100 sends/mo |
| **Studio** | R799/mo (~$45) | 15 candidates, white-label PDFs |
| **Sovereign** | R2 499/mo (~$140) | agency self-hosted, unlimited seats, onboarding day |

Anchor line: *"The demo is free forever. You upgrade when your second candidate asks for it —
that's the whole sales funnel."*

## 1 · Phone

### 1.1 Gatekeeper

```
"Hi, it's {{you}} — I'm not selling anything today, I'm trying to send {{coach}}
a free demo of a tool that does their board-sweeping for them. What's the best
email to put it on so it doesn't die in a folder?"
```

### 1.2 Cold opener (coach on the line)

```
"{{name}}, {{you}}, thirty seconds, then you hang up on me if it's rubbish.

You spend your week opening six job boards and rewriting the same cover letter.
I run a small pipeline that does that part: it hunts the boards four times a day,
drafts the letter and CV, and drops ONE card in your Discord. You tap approve.
Nothing sends without you.

I'm not asking for money. I'm asking you to take the free demo — one candidate,
free forever — and watch three cards land. If they're worse than your Tuesday,
delete it. Did I earn the right to send the link?"
```

### 1.3 Voicemail

```
"{{name}}, {{you}}. One line: there's a free demo of a tool that drafts your
candidates' applications and waits for your tap — nothing sends without you.
The link is in the SMS I just sent. That's the whole message."
```
Then SMS: `Hunta demo (free, no card): <landing-url> — 1 candidate, free forever.`

### 1.4 Discovery questions (use in order, shut up after each)

1. "Walk me through one candidate's week with you right now — boards, letters, sends."
2. "How many hours of that is hunt-and-rewrite, honestly?"
3. "What happens when you're fully booked — which candidates get thin service?"
4. "If the hunt-and-rewrite vanished tomorrow, what would you do with those hours?"
   *(this is the one that sells; let them say it)*
5. "Who approves what goes out today?" *(answer is always "me" — that's the product)*

### 1.5 The close on the phone

```
"Okay. Here's what I'm NOT going to do: quote you a price on this call.
Set up the free demo now while we're on the phone — ten minutes, I stay on the
line. You pick one candidate and one keyword. First card lands by the next hunt
slot — four times a day. When you've tapped approve on a real send, then we talk
about Solo at R299. Fair?"
```

## 2 · Video call (20 minutes)

```
 0-2   "Two promises: no deck, and you leave with the demo running whether you buy or not."
 2-6   Their Tuesday. Take notes visibly. Repeat their number back:
       "So that's roughly {{N}} hours a week of hunt-and-rewrite."
 6-12  LIVE CARD. Open Discord. Read it like a waiter reads specials — slow, pointing.
       Open the letter. "Second paragraph names the company. Check the CV — same facts,
       reordered. It's forbidden from inventing."
12-15  The tap. Approve one. Reject one. "Deleted. Untouched cards die at 72 hours."
15-18  The three fears, unprompted: no auto-send, no invention, no spam (own mailbox,
       20/day cap).
18-20  "Price is R299 for three candidates when you're ready. The demo is free forever
       with one. I'll set it up now or send the link — your call."
```

## 3 · WhatsApp sales sequence (5 touches, stop on any reply)

```
T0  Hi {{name}}! Quick one — I run Hunta, a pipeline that drafts job applications
    for your candidates and waits for your tap. The demo is free forever, one
    candidate, no card: <landing-url>
    Want me to set it up with you on a 10-min call instead?

T+2d  (if silent) The thing everyone asks first: "does it send by itself?" No —
    every application is your ✅. The demo shows you three real cards before you
    decide anything.

T+5d  (if silent) One number, no pitch: last week the pipeline drafted 41
    applications across 3 candidates. Every one human-approved. That's the demo,
    running.

T+9d  (if silent) Last nudge, promise. If the 40 tabs aren't your problem, ignore
    me happily 🙏 If they are: <landing-url>

AFTER DEMO SIGNUP (day 3)  First cards landing? The reject button is the most
    important one this week — it teaches the matcher your taste.
```

## 4 · In-person (career fair / chamber event)

### 30-second booth pitch

```
"We do the forty-tabs part of job hunting. You give it one candidate and one
keyword; it checks eighteen boards four times a day, drafts the letter and CV,
and asks your permission before anything sends. Demo's free forever — scan this."
→ QR to <landing-url>
```

### Booth demo loop (tablet, on a loop, sound off)
Discord open → card lands → tap ✅ → send confirmation → tap ❌ on the next one →
"deleted". Run it continuously; movement sells.

### The question you'll get: "so it applies automatically?"
```
"No — and that's the pitch. Everything waits for a tap. Coaches who were scared
of AI tools are our best customers, because we're the only one that kept them
in the loop."
```

## 5 · DM scripts

### LinkedIn (after they accept)

```
Thanks for connecting, {{name}}. Straight to it: I run a free demo of a pipeline
that does board-sweeping + letter-drafting for coaches — 41 applications through
it last week, zero auto-sends. If your practice touches ZA/ZW/ZM job seekers,
the demo costs you one candidate and nothing else: <landing-url>
If not your world, genuinely happy to just follow your posts.
```

### X / Discord / Telegram communities

```
Built a thing for career coaches in southern Africa: it hunts 18 boards, drafts
the letter+CV, posts one card, waits for your tap. Free demo forever, no card.
Link in my bio / here: <landing-url>. AMA about the guard-rails.
```

## 6 · Persona scripts

### Solo career coach
Pain: capacity. "You're the bottleneck — every extra candidate is an extra Sunday."
Pitch: "The demo gives you one candidate on autopilot-with-a-brake. When card
number four lands and you've only spent one tap on it, R299 for three candidates
is the easiest yes of your month."

### CV-writing / job-search studio
Pain: margin on bundles. "You charge R600–R1500 per CV-and-letter bundle and eat
hours writing them. Hunta produces the bundle in minutes with your brand on the
PDF (Studio tier). Your writers edit instead of type — you triple throughput at
the same price."

### University career centre
Pain: thousands of students, six staff. "Run the demo on one faculty's honours
cohort. The card format is the report your dean wants: matches, reasons,
approvals. Sovereign tier keeps every byte on your own box — your compliance
office will love that sentence."

### Outplacement firm
Pain: billable hours vs. outcomes. "Your consultants bill for judgement, not tab
management. Hunta frees the judgement hours; the audit trail (match %, approve
timestamps) goes into your client reporting."

### Recruiter moving into coaching
Pain: ATS muscle memory. "You know what an ATS is for — employers. This is the
candidate-side desk. Same discipline, opposite direction."

### NGO / workforce-development programme
Pain: donor reporting + scale. "Every approved send is a data point for your
funders: who, where, match %, outcome. Demo one cohort; the reporting story
writes your next grant."

## 7 · Objection scripts (short, repeatable)

**"Does it apply by itself?"** → "No. There is no auto mode. Every send is your tap —
that's a design guarantee, not a setting. The demo will show you the ❌ working too."

**"AI letters are generic."** → "Open the sample. Second paragraph names the company and
mirrors two real requirements. Now show me the letter they wrote at 11pm — same one,
thirty employers. That's generic."

**"My Gmail will get flagged."** → "Sends go from the candidate's own address, to real ads,
human-approved, capped at 20 a day. That's cleaner than most manual spraying — the cap
is the feature."

**"It's expensive."** → "The demo is R0 forever. Solo is R299 — one bundled CV-and-letter
sale at your prices. If Hunta doesn't produce one bundle a month, cancel in the app,
no email needed."

**"I already use ChatGPT."** → "Great — you've felt the magic and the maintenance. Who
sweeps the boards at 06:00? Who purges the PDFs? Who keeps the three countries' CV
formats current? Hunta is the difference between a prompt and a pipeline."

**"My candidates won't trust it."** → "The employer gets a normal email from the
candidate's own address. The candidate sees their own letter in the card before it flies.
The only new thing in their life is that Tuesday got shorter."

**"We're an agency, data can't leave."** → "Sovereign. Your box, your cloud, licence
checked daily, read-only on expiry, never bricked. Data never leaves."

**"Boards will block it."** → "They try; we degrade gracefully. Each hunter fails alone —
last run, one board 403'd and the other ten delivered. You never get a dead pipeline,
just a shorter list that day."

**"I don't have time to set it up."** → "Ten minutes, and I stay on the call. Webhook,
app password, one YAML. If we're not live in ten minutes I owe you a coffee voucher."

**"What's the catch with free?"** → "The demo is the marketing budget. One candidate free
forever, five sends a month. Your second candidate is my invoice."

**"Send me information."** → "Better: the information is a working demo. Ten minutes on
your phone, free forever. I'll send the link and stay available — you'll learn more from
one card than any PDF I could attach."

**"Who else uses it?"** → "We're early — you'd be one of the first in {{country}}, and I'll
say that plainly. What you get for that: my personal number, and pricing locked for a
year."

## 8 · Closing scripts

**Pilot close:** "One candidate, one week, free. If the first three cards aren't better
than your current Tuesday, walk away and I'll still send you the boards list."

**Alternative close:** "Solo or Studio — do you want three candidates or fifteen? Either
way the demo is where we start."

**Assumptive close (post-demo):** "Which candidate goes in first — the accountant or the
marketer? I'll add the YAML while you pick the keyword."

**Takeaway close:** "Honestly, if you enjoy the 40 tabs, don't take the demo — it'll bore
you. This is for people who'd rather coach."

**Deadline close (honest):** "The hunts run 06:00/10:00/14:00/18:00. Set it up before 14:00
and you'll see your first card with your coffee."

**Silence-breaker close:** "You've had the demo three days. One question: what did the
reject button teach you? (That's the real product, by the way.)"

## 9 · Post-demo growth scripts

### Upgrade nudge (day 7, WhatsApp)

```
Week one: {{cards}} cards, {{sends}} sends. Question — how many candidates are
sitting on your bench right now without a pipeline? Solo puts two more on this
exact machine for R299. One tap: <whop-link>
```

### Upsell Solo→Studio

```
You've maxed three candidates twice this month. Studio is R799, fifteen seats,
and your PDFs get YOUR brand on them. Your bench called.
```

### Referral ask (after first interview reported)

```
That interview made my week. One ask: name one other coach who still does the
40 tabs. If they take the demo, your next month is on me — Whop handles it
automatically, no codes.
```

### Win-back

```
The boards kept running. PNet alone moves ~70 finance ads a week in Gauteng.
Your files were never hostage — they're YAMLs, they're yours, they're waiting.
Same link, same free demo, no awkwardness: <landing-url>
```
